    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Use your favorite jar of salsa (or try homemade salsa) to give simple chicken breasts big flavor. "Very easy and very quick, yet it tastes so good people will think you slaved for hours over this dish," says reviewer Jillian.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package mostaccioli pasta</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 (24 ounce) jar picante sauce</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can stewed tomatoes with juice</li>
        <li>1 Â½ cups shredded Mexican-style cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook mostaccioli at a boil until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir ground beef in a large pot over medium-high heat until crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease.</li>
        <li>Add picante sauce and stewed tomatoes to the ground beef; cook, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes soften completely, about 10 minutes. Gently stir the cooked mostaccioli into the ground beef mixture. Add Mexican-style cheese; cook and stir until the cheese is melted, about 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

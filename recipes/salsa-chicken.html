    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Use your favorite jar of salsa (or try homemade salsa) to give simple chicken breasts big flavor. "Very easy and very quick, yet it tastes so good people will think you slaved for hours over this dish," says reviewer Jillian.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless,boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons taco seasoning mix</li>
        <li>1 cup salsa</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sour cream (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Place chicken breasts in the prepared dish. Sprinkle seasoning mix on both sides of chicken breasts; pour salsa on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is tender and juicy and the juices run clear, 25 to 35 minutes.</li>
